# PolynomialSimplifier
This is a simple command line program for parsing and simplifying polynomials that I made for a economics teacher that dealt heavily with large bodies of complex statistics.

When entering polynomials do NOT include spaces or multiplication symbols.
The parser accepts alpha-numeric characters as well as '+' '-' and '^'

sample polynomial
-5+x-y+10+-5x^2--8y+250x^2y-200yxx

this would simplify to
5+x+7y+-5x^2+50x^2y
